# Changelog
## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Developer Tooling (Test Conveyor):** Added `tests/conveyor/` — an autonomous end-to-end pipeline (`run_conveyor.sh` + `smoke_test.py`) that boots RimWorld via Steam, starts a colony headlessly through `POST /api/v1/game/start/devquick`, and smoke-checks core endpoints (version, game state, colonists, maps, game speed, tick progression, save). Standard-library Python only; exit code 0 = all checks pass.

## v1.10.0

### Added
- **New Endpoints (Pawn Social):** Added `PawnSocialController` with a full suite of social endpoints: `GET /api/v1/game/defs/interactions`, `GET /api/v1/pawns/interactions`, `GET /api/v1/pawns/interactions/log`, `GET /api/v1/pawns/opinions`, `GET /api/v1/pawns/relations`, `POST /api/v1/pawns/interactions/force`, `POST /api/v1/pawns/relations/add`, and `DELETE /api/v1/pawns/relations/remove`. *(by @Ilya)*
- **New Endpoints (Learning / Tutorial):** Added `LearningController` exposing the in-game learning helper: `GET /api/v1/client/learning/defs`, `GET /api/v1/client/learning/all`, `GET /api/v1/client/learning/active`, `GET /api/v1/client/learning/concept`, and `POST /api/v1/client/learning/mark-learned`. *(by @Ilya)*
- **New Endpoints (Camera):** Added `POST /api/v1/camera/screenshot` for async base64-encoded screenshot capture with dynamic resizing, `POST /api/v1/camera/screenshot/native` to save a high-quality screenshot directly to disk, and `POST /api/v1/camera/follow/pawn` to jump the camera to a pawn by ID. *(by @Ilya, @jkbennitt)*
- **New Endpoints (UI):** Added `GET /api/v1/ui/alerts` to retrieve all active right-hand screen alerts, `GET /api/v1/ui/windows` to list open windows and their force-pause state, and `POST /api/v1/ui/window/close` to programmatically dismiss windows by type name. *(by @Ilya, @jkbennitt)*
- **New Endpoints (Mod Management):** Added `GET /api/v1/mods/list`, `GET /api/v1/mods/info`, and `GET /api/v1/mods/preview` to query active mod metadata and retrieve mod preview images as base64. *(by @Ilya)*

- **Core — GameThreadDispatcher:** Added a reusable `GameThreadDispatcher` utility for safely marshalling coroutine-based work onto the main Unity thread from async HTTP handlers, replacing scattered ad-hoc threading boilerplate. *(by @Ilya)*
- **Settings Window:** Added git commit hash display to the mod settings window for easier build identification. *(by @Ilya)*

### Changed
- **DDD Architecture Refactor:** Controllers are now organized into domain-scoped folders (`Client/`, `Colony/`, `Pawns/`, `System/`, `World/`, `AI/`) aligning the file structure with the domain map in CLAUDE.md. *(by @Ilya)*
- **Removed Threading Boilerplate:** Deleted redundant `GameThreadUtility` class; all callers migrated to the new `GameThreadDispatcher`. *(by @Ilya)*
- **Documentation:** Restructured API reference into domain-based pages (`game.md`, `pawns.md`, `map.md`, `things.md`, `ui.md`, `system.md`) and added a compact LLM-oriented reference (`llms-compact.md`). *(by @Ilya)*
- **Developer Tooling (Bruno):** Expanded the Bruno API collection with request configs for all new endpoints (social interactions, learning, camera, alerts, mod management, set-forbidden, check-zone). *(by @Ilya, @Yuri)*
- **Developer Tooling (IDE):** Added `.editorconfig` and VS Code workspace settings (`settings.json`, `tasks.json`, `launch.json`) to enforce code standards across the project. *(by @Ilya)*

### Fixed
- **Growing Zone Clarity:** Growing zone creation now returns a specific error message explaining why it failed (cells already occupied by another zone vs. out-of-bounds) instead of a silent null result. Also accepts plant labels (e.g. `"rice"`) in addition to defNames (e.g. `"Plant_Rice"`). *(by @jkbennitt)*
- **Camera Follow Map Scope:** Fixed `POST /api/v1/camera/follow/pawn` to restrict its pawn search to the current map only, preventing erroneous matches against pawns on the world map or other maps. *(by @Ilya)*

- **Developer Tooling (Bruno):** Introduced a comprehensive Bruno API testing collection, complete with generator scripts, environments, and CRUD test suites. *(by @Yuri)*
- **Expanded API Conventions:** Vastly expanded `api_conventions.md` to document response envelopes, HTTP status logic, `snake_case` rules, coordinate systems, and thread-safety models. *(by @jkbennitt, @Ilya)*
- **Documentation Automation:** Created a Python `bump_version.py` script and Jinja macros to automatically sync versions and calculate endpoint counts across the project's markdown and YAML files. Add Russian translation to API endpoints. *(by @Ilya)*
- **Documentation Translation:** Add Russian translation to API endpoints. *(by @Ilya)*

### Changed
- **Thread-Safe Save/Load:** Refactored `GameSave` and `GameLoad` endpoints to safely queue operations on the main Unity thread. Added support for Permadeath filename constraints and a bypass for mod-mismatch dialogs. *(by @Ilya)*
- **Growing Zone Coordinates:** The growing zone creation endpoint now accepts Rect coordinates (`PointA`/`PointB`) instead of individual cell lists to match standard designation patterns. *(by @jkbennitt)*
- **Dynamic Versioning:** `RIMAPI_Settings.cs` now pulls the mod version dynamically from `About.xml` via `LoadedModManager`, eliminating hardcoded version strings in C#. *(by @Ilya)*
- **Metadata:** Added Harmony to the mod dependencies list and updated the documentation URL in `About.xml`. *(by @Ilya)*
- **Codebase Formatting:** Refactored project files to default to 4-space tabs for consistency. *(by @Ilya)*

### Fixed
- **Bulk Work Priorities NRE:** Fixed a `NullReferenceException` and 500 Internal Server Error when processing unmapped JSON keys or empty payloads in the colonist priorities endpoint. *(by @Ilya)*
- **Growing Zone 500 Error:** Fixed a crash that occurred when attempting to create a growing zone where all designated cells were already occupied by existing zones. *(by @jkbennitt)*
- **Pawn Edit Routing & Logic:** Fixed a 404 routing error for `/api/v1/pawn/edit/basic` in compiled release builds, and resolved a bug where partial name updates were ignored. *(by @Ilya)*
- **Empty POST Body Crashes:** Fixed core routing logic so missing payloads or `Content-Length` headers safely initialize an empty DTO instead of throwing a generic `NullReferenceException`. *(by @Ilya)*

## v1.8.2

### Documentation Infrastructure (Refactor)

- Migrated from a single API YAML file to a modular, folder-based structure.
- Multi-Language Support — Added dedicated localization folders (ja/, ru/) with fallback logic to ensure translated pages remain functional even if specific endpoints aren't yet translated.
- Automated Validation — Introduced a Python-based sanity checker (mkdocs_check_api.py) that cross-references C# [Route] attributes against YAML documentation to prevent "documentation drift".
- Auto-Fixer Tools — Added a synchronization script (mkdocs_fix_yaml_methods.py) that automatically updates YAML HTTP methods to match the C# source of truth.
- Visual Enhancements — Implemented a tagging system (e.g., UI, Map, Pawn) with custom CSS badges to help users filter endpoints by category.

### Developer Workflow & CI/CD

- GitHub Actions Integration — Integrated the formatting, fixing, and validation scripts into the deployment pipeline to guarantee documentation accuracy on every push to master.
- Improved Repository Hygiene — Optimized .gitignore to prevent Python bytecode (.pyc) and C# build artifacts from bloating the repository.

### Bug Fixes & API Refinement

- Unique Endpoint Routing — Refactored ImageController to use unique paths for GET and POST actions (e.g., /api/v1/item/change/image), resolving documentation collisions and improving REST clarity.

Fix UI blinking during texture make readable

## v1.4.0

Author: IlyaChichkov

Add new endpoints:

[POST] /api/v1/game/speed
[POST] /api/v1/game/select-area
[GET] /api/v1/map/things-at

Author: braasdas

This patch implements high-performance endpoints and data optimizations required for a real-time "Live Optical View" web interface. The primary goals were reducing network bandwidth (via RLE compression) and minimizing game thread impact (via caching).

1. NEW API ENDPOINTS
--------------------
[GET] /api/v1/map/terrain
- Purpose: Fetches the entire map's terrain and floor grid.
- Optimization: Uses custom Run-Length Encoding (RLE) to compress the grid data. This reduces payload size by ~90% for typical maps, making full map transmission viable over the network.

[GET] /api/v1/colonists/positions
- Purpose: A lightweight endpoint returning only Pawn ID, MapID, X, and Z coordinates.
- Optimization: Designed for high-frequency polling (e.g., 10-60Hz). Implements 0.1s server-side caching to prevent flooding the main game thread.

[GET] /api/v1/terrain/image
- Purpose: Fetches the texture/icon for specific terrain or floor defs (e.g., "SandstoneTile", "CarpetRed").
- Why: Required for the client to reconstruct the map visually.

[GET] /api/v1/map/plants
- Purpose: Fast retrieval of all vegetation (trees, crops). separated from general "things" to allow different polling rates.

[GET] /api/v1/map/things/radius
- Purpose: Efficiently queries items/buildings only within a specific circle. Useful for culling or "fog of war" logic.

2. LOGIC & HELPER IMPROVEMENTS
------------------------------
TextureHelper.cs (Major Fixes)
- Problem: Many buildings (Walls, Vents, Coolers) do not have a standard `uiIcon`.
- Fix: Added deep lookup logic to check `graphicData`, `graphic.MatSingle`, and `graphic.MatSouth`. This ensures almost all buildings now return a valid base64 image.
- Added fallback case-insensitive search for DefNames to handle minor typo/mod inconsistencies.

MapHelper.cs
- Added the RLE compression logic for the Terrain/Floor grids.
- Separated "Natural Terrain" (soil, stone) from "Constructed Floors" (wood, tile) into two distinct layers for better rendering control.

ResourcesHelper.cs
- Updated `BuildingDto` and `ItemsDto` to include `Rotation` and `Size` (x, z).
- Why: Critical for the client to correctly orient non-square objects (e.g., Beds, Tables) which were previously rendering as 1x1 squares or unrotated images.

3. NEW DATA MODELS
------------------
- MapTerrainDto: Handles the compressed grid arrays and palette lookups.
- PawnPositionDto: Minimalist structure for the fast position endpoint.

These changes are largely additive and designed to run alongside existing logic without breaking current endpoints. The modifications to `TextureHelper` are strictly improvements to robustness and should benefit the entire API.
